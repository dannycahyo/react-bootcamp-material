# Let's Flashback to How We Used to Build Websites

- Multi Page Application (MPA)

It requires the browser to load a new page for each action taken by the user.

- Single Page Application (SPA)

You will only see one HTML file which is the index.html file. The rest of the HTML is generated by JavaScript.
