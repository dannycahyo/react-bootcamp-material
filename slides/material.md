# Let's Flashback to How We Used to Build Websites

- Multi Page Application (MPA)

It requires the browser to load a new page for each action taken by the user.

- Single Page Application (SPA)

You will only see one HTML file which is the index.html file. The rest of the HTML is generated by JavaScript.

# Which One Better?

# The Trend Has Changed from MPA to SPA

# Single Page Applications

- Enhanced User Experience
- Framework and Tooling Support
- API-Driven Development: SPAs are often built to consume APIs

---

# Rendering Method

- Client Side Rendering (CSR)
- Server Side Rendering (SSR)
- Static Site Generation (SSG)

Which one is for SPA and which one is for MPA?

# React Popularity

# Let's See The Real World Example

### |> Visit Youtube Website

Imagine how painful if we need to code the whole website using vanilla JavaScript or React create element API.

The question is what makes React so special and so popular?

# Exercise: Creating Basic Product Page

- Add a few elements, such as headings, input, and list.
- Use vanilla JavaScript to make the UI.
  - Get the root element
  - Create the element document.createElement
  - Append the element to the root element

---

# Exercise: Creating Basic Product Page

- Add a few elements, such as headings, input, and list.
- Use React API to make the UI.
  - Get the root element
  - Create the element with React.createElement
  - Render the element with React DOM

---

# Exercise: Creating Basic Product Page

- Add a few elements, such as headings, input, and list.
- Use JSX to make the UI.
  - Get the root element
  - Create the element with HTML syntax
  - Render the element with React DOM

# Component Study Case

1. ### Visit Youtube Website
2. ### Let's see and analyze the similar peace of the UI

---

# Let's Make Our Own Component

![DEMO_TIME](https://media.makeameme.org/created/demo-time-5b1ab8.jpg)

---

# The Importance of Components in React

- Components are the building blocks of a React application.
- Promote a modular architecture by breaking the UI into reusable, isolated pieces.

---

## Why use components?

1. Reusability

   - Write once, use multiple times.
   - Reduces code redundancy and improves efficiency.

2. Maintainability
   - Smaller, more focused code.
   - Easier to understand, debug, and update.

---

## Why use components?

3. Scalability

   - Organized and structured codebase.
   - Easier to add or modify features.

4. Separation of Concerns
   - Each component handles a specific task or functionality.
   - Simplifies code collaboration and reduces conflicts.

# Let's Back Into The Button Counter

## Question

- What happend if we want to render the counter instead of just pop up on the alert?

---

# useState Hooks

#### Let's just simplify the definition of state in React

In React, `state` refers to an object that holds and manages data within a component. It represents the current condition or values that can change over time. By using state, React components can keep track of and update their data, leading to dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

---

# Let's Add Additional Features To The Button Counter

## Question

- How do we add the counter state into the local storage?

---

# useEffect Hooks

`useEffect` is a React Hook that lets you synchronize a component with an external system. Effects let you run some code after rendering so that you can synchronize your component with some system outside of React.

---

# Final Project

### Making A Product Page

Acceptance Criteria

- As a user, I want to be able to see the list of products
- As a user, I want to be able to search for products
- As a user, I want to able to clear my products search
- As a user, I want to be able to know my last keyword product search

---

# Final Project Step By Step

1. Fetch product data from the API, you can use https://dummyjson.com/products for the API.
2. Display a list of products
3. Implement a search functionality
4. Add a button to clear search results
5. Keep the user search keywords to persistent storage

---

# Final Project Hints

- Use `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for managing state and side effects
- Fetch the product data inside a `useEffect` hook
- Implement an event handler for the search input and the clear button
- Save the state into local storage using `useEffect` hooks
- Use a `ProductCard` component to display each product in a card-like layout

# Good Luck!
